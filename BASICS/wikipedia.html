     <p class="para8">Kalyan made his acting debut in 1996 with Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi

        Banner, and co-starred Supriya Yarlagadda, granddaughter of Akkineni Nageswara Rao.
         The film employed a unique marketing campaign prior to its release. Initially, posters 
         featuring Kalyan were released with the question, "Who is this guy?". Later, before the 
         film's release, posters declaring "This is our Kalyan" further heightened audience interest
         .[47] Released in October 1996, the film was a moderate success at the box-office.[46] 
         Kalyan’s performance and martial arts skills received significant attention</p>
